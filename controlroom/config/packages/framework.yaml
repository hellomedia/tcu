framework:

        cookie_samesite: lax
# !!! ATTN: for remember me cookie, it is set in security.yaml firewall config !!!
# SAMESITE STRATEGY
# =================
# cookie samesite attribute (attribute added to every cookie):
#   - 'strict' adds protection against CSRF attacks via GET.
#      Easyadmin uses GET everywhere
#      Should we use 'strict' for easyadmin, which is a sensitive environment ??
#        This means request NOT originating from the site (ie: navigating to the site from chrome's adress bar suggestion, or an email link)
#        will require log in, since the remember me cookie will NOT be sent in that case.
#        NB: Effectively, this renders the remember_me cookie useless.
#  !!! SECURITY:
#  * - !!! No need for CSRF token if samesite cookie ='lax' and method=POST,
#  *  since cookies are not shared with third party origin for POST requests when samesite="lax".

# !!! ===> So we are good with 'lax' if we use POST, no CSRF token necessary.
#
#   -'lax' is secure enough if sensitive operations are done via POST (with CSRF token).
#        ==> we defintely can use it for the user facing app.
#        Lax allows users to be logged in with remember me cookie when they click on email link,
#        or navigate to the site from search or adress bar suggestion.
